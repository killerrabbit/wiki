### Description

This module allows commands to be abbreviated using the syntax
`/BEGIN.` where `BEGIN` is the beginning of the command. For example,
the command `GLINE` could be used as `/gl.`, assuming no other
commands start with those same letters. 

### Configuration Tags

This module does not require any extra configuration, other than the
`<module>` tag to load it. 

### Modes

This module does not implement any extra user or channel modes.

### Extended Bans

This module implements no extended bans.

### Commands

None, but allows existing commands to be abbreviated.

### Special Notes

If more than one command begins with the `BEGIN` text, a list of
matching commands will be given and no command will be executed.

This module will not allow abbreviation of aliases set by
[m_alias](/wiki/Modules/alias.html) as these are not actual
commands. If you wish to shorten an alias, make a shorter copy of that
alias.
